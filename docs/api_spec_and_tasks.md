## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.py", "Contains configuration settings for the application."),
    ("models.py", "Defines the User and Report classes. User should be implemented first as Report depends on it."),
    ("forms.py", "Defines the forms for user input."),
    ("views.py", "Defines the routes for the application. Depends on models.py and forms.py."),
    ("services.py", "Defines the services for generating and saving reports. Depends on models.py."),
    ("main.py", "The main entry point of the application. Depends on all other files."),
    ("tests.py", "Contains tests for the application. Depends on all other files.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",

]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains the configuration settings for the application, including the database connection string and other application-wide settings.

'models.py' defines the User and Report classes. The User class has three attributes: education, qualifications, and english_levels. The Report class has three attributes: id, user (a reference to a User object), and content.

'forms.py' defines the forms for user input. These forms are used in the views to collect data from the user.

'services.py' defines the services for generating and saving reports. These services are used in the views to process the data collected from the user and generate reports.

'views.py' defines the routes for the application. These routes handle requests from the user and return responses.

'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the application and starts the server.

'tests.py' contains tests for the application. These tests ensure that the application is working correctly.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no unclear point at the moment. However, we need to keep communication open and frequent to ensure that any potential issues are addressed promptly.
