## Implementation approach
We will use Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, to build the application. The user interface will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For data validation and processing, we will use Python's built-in libraries. We will use SQLite for data storage and SQLAlchemy as the ORM. For generating the report, we will use the ReportLab library. We will also use pytest for testing.

## Python package name
```python
"nz_immigration_report_generator"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "views.py",
    "services.py",
    "tests.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "templates/report.html",
    "static/styles.css",
    "static/scripts.js"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User{
        +str education
        +str qualifications
        +str english_levels
        +__init__(education: str, qualifications: str, english_levels: str)
        +update_info(education: str, qualifications: str, english_levels: str)
    }
    class Report{
        +int id
        +User user
        +str content
        +__init__(user: User)
        +generate()
        +save()
        +print()
    }
    User "1" -- "1" Report: generates
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant U as User
    participant R as Report
    M->>U: create user(education, qualifications, english_levels)
    U->>M: return user
    M->>R: create report(user)
    R->>M: return report
    M->>R: generate report
    R->>M: return generated report
    M->>R: save report
    M->>R: print report
    M->>U: update user info(education, qualifications, english_levels)
    U->>M: return updated user
    M->>R: regenerate report(updated user)
    R->>M: return regenerated report
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
